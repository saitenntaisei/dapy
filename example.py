# This example demonstrates how to use the dapy library to simulate a distributed algorithm

# the learn graph algorithm.

# NOTE:
# Timestamps such as `0:00:03.602244` indicate the time elapsed since the beginning of the simulated execution.
# The time does not refer to any real time, but to the simulation time (virtual time in the simulated environment).
# Communication delays are defined randomly based on the model.
# The format is `hour:minute:second.decimals`.
