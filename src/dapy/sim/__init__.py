dapy.sim

This module defines the runtime environment for simulating distributed algorithms.

The main components of this module include:
- `.simulator.Simulator`: The main class that runs a simulation according to a given system model and an algorithm.
- `.configuration.Configuration`: Represents the state of a system. This is a collection of the state of each process.
- `.trace.Trace`: When tracing is enabled, this class stores the entire history of the simulation.

In addition, the module provides a set of utility classes and functions to facilitate the simulation process, including:
- `.settings.Settings`: Configuration settings for the simulation.
- `.timed.TimedEvent`: Represents an event associated with a scheduled time.
- `.timed.TimedConfiguration`: Represents a configuration with a creation time.
