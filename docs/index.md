# Dapy: Documentation

The documentation is still very scarce, but you may find the following useful:

* [`API doc`](api/) generated automatically from the docstrings.
* [`README.md`]({% link README.md %}) that explains how to generate the docs locally.
* sample code:
    * [`sample-algorithm.md`]({% link sample-algorithm.md %}) illustrates how to define an algorithm
    * [`sample-execution.md`]({% link sample-execution.md %}) illustrates how to run a distributed execution
